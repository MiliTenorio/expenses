# expenses

Expenses is an application for monitoring personal spending. You can register your expenses with the title, amount and date of the expense, and the application will list these expenses, as well as report via a graph which days of the last week had the most expenses.

## About the project

This is another application developed through an introductory Flutter course. In this module we focus on learning how to create, combine and customize widgets in an application.

We have the interactions of Create, Read and Delete expenses with 3 attributes: (1) title, (2) value and (3) date. And a graph that relates to the date and amount information.
